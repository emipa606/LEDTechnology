I have added sensible version numbers to the about in the mod in game so you can know which version you are on. 
This mod contains a base DLL that will be used to make some features better. 
Save game will load with no problem but any old structures must be replaced asap (sorry) to register the newly placed structures with the DLL. You can identify the strutures that use DLL by looking at the description. Last line will end with "..." while normal prior to 0.4 just ends with "." - The reason to do this now is so that every next update will automagically use any new DLL code without problems like this. 
Sorry for any inconvienice caused.. I admit I am still learning but I would like to make a really nice mod and trying my best to minimise collaterol damage! Thanks for your support!

Renamed this mod to "LED Technology" to avoid clash of names from another mod not hosted on Workshop. 
Save game will not crash. MOD ID is still the same just Name was changed. Phew!

Fixed alignement issue when rotating centred LED strips- They did not align up properly when rotated. 
Added a Corner LED Strip which fit snug against walls to give that illumination effect

(save games will break here if you used the first version - Sorry :[ ) Added LED hydroponics - 10/09/16 01:30AM (First Version) Initial mod pack with centre (Small LED Strip) **If you subscribed to this mod before 11/09/2016** For early subscribers (first Version)(with just LED strip), I am sorry but the save game will break :( I had to make some major changes - So before updating - please remove ALL LED's Save, then update the MOD. I will add version history from now on. There a few more things I want to add. All udpated will be tested progressivly to prevent save game fixes. Order of loading is not important yet.
